In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with Core Data.  Consider this scenario: You fetch a managed object from Core Data, make changes to its properties, and then save the context.  However, if you retain the object fetched from the context and do not release it properly (either manually using `release` or `autorelease` in older Objective-C versions or by letting ARC handle it properly), a retain cycle might occur. This happens when the managed object context retains the object, and the object in turn retains something that ultimately retains the context again. The resulting retain cycle prevents the object from being deallocated, even after the context is saved and you believe the changes are persisted. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory leaks, and crashes later on.
