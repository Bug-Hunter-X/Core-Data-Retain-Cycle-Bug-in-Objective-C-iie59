The solution lies in understanding Core Data's memory management.  Fetched managed objects are typically managed by the context.  Unless you have a specific reason to retain them for an extended period beyond the scope of your immediate task, you should generally avoid explicitly retaining them.  ARC will handle the deallocation when they are no longer needed. 

In the provided example, this is done by removing the explicit retain call (or any other form of object retention outside of a specific task). The context will correctly manage the object's lifecycle and deallocate it when appropriate.  Here is an example of what the improved code might look like: 

```objectivec
// CoreDataRetainCycleBugSolution.m

- (void)updateManagedObject:(NSManagedObject *)managedObject {
    // Make changes to the managedObject properties
    // ... your code ...

    // No need to retain the managedObject
    // [managedObject retain]; // Removed - Avoid explicit retain
    
    NSError *error = nil;
    if (![self.managedObjectContext save:&error]) {
        NSLog(@"Error saving context: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}
```
By eliminating unnecessary retains and letting ARC (or manual memory management techniques in older projects) handle the deallocation, we break the retain cycle and prevent memory leaks.
